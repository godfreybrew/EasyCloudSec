## Integrating OWASP ZAP for DAST in AWS DevSecOps Pipeline
## Introduction
Welcome to this step where we'll integrate OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) for Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) within our AWS DevSecOps pipeline. By incorporating DAST into our pipeline, we can automatically scan web applications for security vulnerabilities during the build process.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:
1. AWS CodeBuild project set up (as discussed in previous steps).

2. AWS CodePipeline configured (as discussed in previous steps).

3. A sample web application URL to scan.

## Integration Steps
Let's go through the steps to integrate OWASP ZAP in our AWS DevSecOps pipeline.

### Update buildspec.yml
Open the buildspec.yml file in your AWS CodeCommit repository and replace the code, so your buildspec.yml file should look something like this:
```yaml
version: 0.1
phases:
  build:
    commands:
    - |-
        apt-get update
        apt-get -y install wget
        apt-get -y install default-jdk
        wget https://github.com/zaproxy/zaproxy/releases/download/v2.11.1/ZAP_2.11.1_Linux.tar.gz
        tar -xvf ZAP_2.11.1_Linux.tar.gz
        cd ZAP_2.11.1
        ./zap.sh -cmd -quickurl https://www.example.com -quickprogress -quickout ../zap_report.html 
artifacts:
  files:
    - zap_report.html
```
Now Just Commit the Changes!

### In this code:

1. We update the system and install necessary utilities (apt-get update, apt-get install -y wget default-jdk).
2. We download and unzip OWASP ZAP (wget, mkdir, tar).
3. We navigate to the ZAP directory and execute the ZAP scan with specific parameters (sh zap.sh -quickurl https://www.example.com -quickprogress -quickout zap_report.html).
4. The resulting zap_report.html is stored in the artifacts.

### Monitor the Pipeline
Go to AWS CodeBuild and navigate to your CodeBuild project. You should see a new build triggered by your CodePipeline. Observe the progress and logs.

### Access DAST Report
Once the build is complete, go to the build details and scroll down to locate the artifacts section. You can download the zap_report.html file from the s3 link, which contains the results of the OWASP ZAP scan.

## Review and Remediate
Review the ZAP report for identified security vulnerabilities. Work with the development team to remediate the issues. This might involve creating JIRA or ServiceNow tickets for tracking and assigning tasks to the development team.

## Congratulations! 
You've successfully integrated OWASP ZAP for DAST in your AWS DevSecOps pipeline.
