# Setting Up SonarCloud Integration with AWS CodeCommit - Part 2

### Introduction
Welcome to this step where we'll complete the setup for integrating SonarCloud with our AWS CodeCommit project. In the previous step(STEP4), we created a buildspec.yml file in our CodeCommit repository and left the placeholders empty. Now, we'll create a SonarCloud account, organization, project, and generate a security token to enable seamless integration.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have completed the STEP4, creating the buildspec.yml file in your CodeCommit repository.

## Creating a SonarCloud Account
1. Navigate to [SonarCloud](https://www.sonarsource.com/products/sonarcloud/) and sign up using your preferred method (GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, or GitLab).

2. If using GitHub, log in to your GitHub account when prompted to connect it with SonarCloud.

## Creating a New Organization and Project
1. Once logged in, click on the "+" icon and select "Create new organization."

2. Manually create a new organization with a unique name (e.g., "MyAWS-SecurityOrg") and choose the free plan. Click on "Create organization."

3. After creating the organization, click on the "+" icon again and select "Create a new project."

4. Provide a project key (e.g., "MyAWS-SecurityProject") and set the visibility to public. Click on "Set up."

## Generating a Security Token
1. Go to your account settings by clicking on your account name in the top right corner, then select "Account."

2. Click on the "Security" tab and generate a new token. Provide a unique name (e.g., "AWS-Token") and click on "Generate."

3. Copy the generated token and store it in a secure place, as it won't be visible again.

## Updating buildspec.yml with SonarCloud Details
1. Switch back to your AWS CodeCommit repository.

2. Open the buildspec.yml file.
```yaml
version: 0.1
phases:
  build:
    commands:
      - mvn verify sonar:sonar -Dsonar.projectKey=projectKey -Dsonar.organization=projectOrg -Dsonar.host.url=https://sonarcloud.io -Dsonar.login=token 
```

3. Replace the placeholder values in the sonar:sonar command with the actual values obtained from SonarCloud:

• your_project_key: Replace with the SonarCloud project key.

• your_organization: Replace with the SonarCloud organization name.

• your_sonarcloud_token: Replace with the generated SonarCloud security token.


4. Update the author name and email if needed.

5. Commit the changes. Now, your buildspec.yml file is configured with the correct SonarCloud details.

## Congratulations🥳
Congratulations! You've successfully created a SonarCloud account, organization, project, and generated a security token. Your buildspec.yml file is now updated with the necessary SonarCloud integration details.

In the next lecture, we'll proceed to set up CodeBuild to compile your code in CodeCommit and analyze it using SonarCloud.
